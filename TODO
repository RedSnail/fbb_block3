cinadei_only:
lypooligosaccarides: BAM33113.1 (involved in their sythesis, then they're exported by ABC transporters)
capsule biosynthesis: BAM31900.1 (amino oxidase according to SMART, UDP-galactopyranose mutase according to uniprot)
                      BAM32000.1 (dTDP-6-deoxy-L-hexose 3-O-methyltransferase, SMART agrees)
                      BAM32972.1 (||--||)

hepatic_power:
lypopolysaccarides: BAM32363.1 (UDP-glucose/GDP-mannose dehydrogenase)
capsule: BAM33186.1 (UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase - glucuronate manufacture)
T6SS: BAM32828.1
      BAM32827.1
      BAM32664.1 DEATH TO MACROPHAGES
      BAM32665.1
      BAM32698.1 (TF that rules this stuff)
toxins: BAM31971.1 (CDT toxin: causes DNA cleavage in mammalian cells)
